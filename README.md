## 🎯 Magic Number Guesser
A simple game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. After each guess, the program gives feedback and lets the user decide whether to continue or quit.

## 🐢 Tortoise vs Hare Race
Simulates a race between a tortoise and a hare over a user-defined distance. Each "turn," both animals move forward or backward based on random speeds and directions.

## 🪙 Coin Tosser
Simulates tossing a coin a user-specified number of times. Tracks how many times heads and tails appear, and gives a counter showing the result balance.

## 📐 Rectangle Area Calculator
Takes user input for length and width, then calculates and displays the area of a rectangle.

## 📏 Rectangle Perimeter Calculator
Takes user input for length and width, then calculates and displays the perimeter of a rectangle.

## 🔺 Triangle Area Calculator
Asks for the base and height of a triangle and calculates its area using the formula `0.5 * base * height`.

## 🚀 Velocity Calculator
Calculates the velocity of a ball in space using the formula `distance / time`.

## 🧮 Circle Circumference Calculator
Takes the radius of a circle and calculates the circumference using the formula `2 * π * radius`.

## 🌡️ Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter
Converts a temperature input in Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula `(F - 32) * 5/9`.

## 🧠 Custom Calculator
A fully functional calculator that parses a math equation string and evaluates it. Supports:
- Addition `+`
- Subtraction `-`
- Multiplication `*`
- Division `/`
- Exponents `^`
- Square roots using `sqrt`

It handles multiple operators and parentheses-free expressions using operator precedence.
